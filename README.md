Hi :smirk:

This is a collection of proyects that I live-copied from The Coding Train youtube channel. Why? I wanted to learn p5js on my spare time, but after a full day of work I was so tired that I didn't have the energy to think. My solution was to just do the challenges exactly as Daniel Shiffman did them. It was a nice and fun way to get me to sleep.

To see the full list of challenges [check the youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH)

## How to run?

Each folder is a *different and isolated* proyect. To run a proyect: 

1. Copy the folder `libraries` inside the folder. Ei. `clock/libraries`
2. Open the `index.html` inside a folder on a browser.

That's it! Now you should see a working clock.

## Tecnologies

All proyects use JavaScript on the browser with the [p5 libray](https://p5js.org/)

I also used Atom IDE because it has a nice pluggin that allows viewing changes on the browser without reloading the page. Its name is *atom-live-server*. It's really usefull and saves a lot of time.

After installing the plugging. Go to the `index.html` and press Ctrl+Alt+L. 
There should be a running p5js app on `http://localhost:3000/`.
