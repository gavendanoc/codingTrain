## How to run?

Each folder is a different, isolated proyect. To run a proyect: 

1. Copy the folder `libraries` inside the folder, on the root.
2. Open index.html on a browser.

That's it!

## Tecnologies

I used Atom IDE because it has a nice pluggin that allows viewing changes on the browser without reloading the page. It's really usefull and saves a lot of time.
